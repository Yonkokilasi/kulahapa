## Description
Ever been to a restaurant or hotel and you struggled to get a menu . Well we have to and that is what lead to the creation of Kula Hapa.
What we aim to do is eliminate the use of hard copy menu's . We believe that in this ever advancing digital world Analog Menu's have no place in it. Kula Hapa also supports going green thus we aim to protect trees as Menu's will no longer need to be printed.
Even though some food establishments alreadt have digital menu's , we feel that is a hastle for an end-user to download the menu for each establishment.That is a lot of work in a world where everything is a click away.
## How it Works
In Kula Hapa we have the menu's for all the food establishments that have partnered with us.The twist comes in whereby you can only access the menu of the establishment while you are in the establishment.That way all you need to do is connect to the establishment's wifi and you will have the menu in seconds.
